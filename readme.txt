Contributors: strangerstudios, paidmembershipspro
Tags: user profile, user fields, memberships, user meta, user profile, users
Requires at least: 5.4
Tested up to: 6.2
Requires PHP: 6.1.1
Stable tag: 1.8.3

Create custom user profile fields collected at registration or membership checkout for your WordPress users, members, and site admins.

== Description ==

### IMPORTANT UPDATE

Since PMPro version 2.9 was released on July 18, 2022, this plugin is no longer needed to manage user fields. With PMPro 2.9+, you can manage user fields from the Memberships > Settings > User Fields page in the WP admin dashboard. Any custom code written to work with Register Helper will still work as intended with only PMPro 2.9 installed.

*This plugin will no longer be maintained.*

If you were using the member directory features, you should use the [PMPro Member Directory plugin](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/member-directory/).

If you were using the Register Form module with PMPro, you should consider using the [PMPro Sign Up Shortcode plugin](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-signup-shortcode/)).

If you were using the Register Form without PMPro, you can continue to use this plugin, but note that it will no longer be maintained.

If you were using the Restrict by Email/Username feature, you should use [this code snippet instead](https://github.com/strangerstudios/pmpro-snippets-library/blob/dev/checkout/restrict-checkout-by-email-or-username.php).

### The most popular WordPress plugin for custom user fields and member profiles.

Create custom user profile fields and collect additional user information at registration or membership checkout for your WordPress users, members, and site admins.

User fields can be added in many locations including:

* The membership checkout page in Paid Memberships Pro
* Captured on the user's frontend profile page.
* Managed in the WordPress admin area on the "Your Profile" screen (for users).
* Edited by site admins only on the "Edit User Profile" screen in the WordPress admin.

This plugin also allows you to restrict membership registration for a list of approved email addresses or usernames.

[Learn more about custom user profile fields and member registration fields in our documentation site](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-register-helper-add-checkout-and-profile-fields/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-regiser-helper).

### Supports Multiple Field Types
Choose from a variety of popular user field types to capture additional information about your members. Fields can be customized by the member's selected or active membership level. The most popular field types include:

* Text and Textarea
* Select and Select2 (multi-select)
* Checkbox, Grouped Checkboxes, and Radio Select
* Date
* File Upload
* Read-only
* HTML (generates any desired HTML)
* Hidden

= Adding Fields For Specific Membership Levels =
This plugin is built for Paid Memberships Pro, the top WordPress membership plugin that's 100% free. You can add your fields for all members, or choose to show a field for specific members only. For example, allow your Premium level members to add a full length bio and upload a resume, while your Starter members can only add a brief bio and no file upload.

Custom user fields are a way to gather more information about your members and create a more tailored, premium experience.

= Conditional User Field Logic =
Any registered field can be a conditional field. These fields use JavaScript to dynamically hide or show based on another field's value.

= Create a Public or Private Member Directory =
Many sites use these custom fields to build a member directory for site visitors or members. You can customize which fields are displayed based on membership level. Read the [Member Directory and Profiles for PMPro](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/member-directory/?utm_source=wordpress-org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=pmpro-register-helper) documentation page for more information on this feature.

= Restrict Membership Checkout by Email Address or Username =
Add your list of custom "approved" email addresses or usernames to the "Restrict by Email" or "Restrict by Username" field on the Memberships > Settings > Membership Levels > Edit Level admin page.

The register helper plugin has been updated to update user meta fields during this hook in addition to the pmpro_after_checkout hook. (Because for PayPal Standard, when pmpro_after_checkout is called, the $_SESSION vars are unavailable to it. So other plugins relying on the pmpro_after_checkout hook may have issues with PayPal Standard.)

= .3 =
* Added id="pmpro_checkout_box-NAME" to pmpro_checkout tables.
* Added pmprorh_add_checkout_box($name, $label = NULL, $description = "", $order = NULL) which will add a new section and optional description to the checkout page that you can then use in as the $where parameter in pmprorh_add_registration_field(). Updated instructions.

* Fixed typo in readme example
* Fixed the check for the "showrequired" parameter, which when set on a field adds "* required" to the field display.

= .2.2 =
* Added the register-form.php module as a stand alone registration form. (For use without PMPro)
* Added the "divclass" property to fields, which will add a class to the wrapping div around the fields.
* Added a span * required to required fields.
* Added a $pmprorh_options global. Will be putting these into a settings/options page eventually.
* Updated pmprorh_getProfileFields to check for manage_options instead of edit_user for "admin" setting.

= .2.1 =
* Started tracking changes.
* Added save_function as a parameter to the add field function. This function will be called with the parameters ($user_id, $field_name, $value) when the field is saved after checkout or in the profile.
